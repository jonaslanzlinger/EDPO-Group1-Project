# Plotter

This is a simple plotter that uses the matplotlib library to plot the recorded mqtt data
from the factory over time.

## Files
* data-plotter.py - Python script that reads the data from the data folder and plots it (full data).
* data-plotter-customized.py - Python script that reads the data from the data folder and plots it (data for report).

## Usage

Run the python script or the jupyter notebook to plot the data referenced from the data folder.
The result shows two plots one for station VGR_1 and one for station HBW_1 where the values
emitted by each station are plotted against the time. This helps to visualize the data and
understand the behavior of the stations over time.
